This web application predicts the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using machine learning models. The app takes inputs such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other medical features to predict whether an individual is at risk of CVD.

## Features:
- User-friendly web interface to input medical data.
- Predicts cardiovascular disease using machine learning (Logistic Regression model).
- Provides real-time feedback based on input data.
- The model is pre-trained and saved for quick predictions.

## Technologies:
- Python 3.x
- Flask (Web framework)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- Joblib (Saving/loading models)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
Before setting up the application, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version by running:
